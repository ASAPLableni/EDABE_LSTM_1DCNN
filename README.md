# EDABE_LSTM_1DCNN

This repository shows how to use EDABE LSTM-1D CNN Model to correct artifacts automatically in Electrodermal Activity (EDA) signal. To learn how to use the model, EDABE_LSTM_1DCNN_ModelExample.ipynb shows how to charge the model and the needed functions to pre-process and post-process the output of the signal. A random signal is choosen from the test set of [EDABE](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/w8fxrg4pv5) dataset to show the performance of the model. The model itself can be found in the folder Model. 

This algorithm is part of a research work which is under a submission.
